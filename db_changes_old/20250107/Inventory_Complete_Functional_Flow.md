### Key Requirements:
1. **Inventory Management**: Track the raw material grades, pipe creation on the tube machine, and subsequent processing on the laser machine.
2. **Tube Machine Parameters**: You’ll need to track pipe creation by diameter (OD), thickness, and grade.
3. **Laser Machine Processing**: After pipes are created, they’re processed by the laser machine to produce smaller lengths.
4. **Tracking & Updating Stock**: As the raw materials are used, and pipes are processed, you need to update the inventory.

### High-Level Workflow:
1. **Raw Material Input (Grades)**:
   - Your system should manage different grades of raw materials, which will be input into the tube machine. 
   - The raw material inventory should be updated when materials are received and when they are used to create pipes.

2. **Tube Machine Setup**:
   - Each pipe produced by the tube machine will have parameters like:
     - Outer Diameter (OD)
     - Thickness
     - Grade of material
   - Your software should allow operators to input these parameters when setting up the machine, and then track the length of the pipe produced.

3. **Pipe Creation**:
   - Once the tube machine creates a pipe, the system should generate a unique ID or batch number for that pipe. 
   - The created pipes can be stored in inventory, and their status should be updated accordingly.

4. **Laser Machine Setup**:
   - The laser machine will take these full-length pipes and cut them into smaller lengths.
   - Your software should track which pipe goes into the laser machine, its original size, and the number of smaller pieces produced.
   - After processing, the smaller pieces (cut pipe lengths) should be recorded and added back to the inventory.

5. **Inventory Management**:
   - You will need to keep track of the following:
     - **Raw Material Inventory**: The grades and quantities available.
     - **Pipe Inventory**: The full-length pipes created by the tube machine, identified by their parameters (OD, thickness, grade).
     - **Cut Pipe Inventory**: The smaller lengths created by the laser machine.
     - **Used Inventory**: Track what raw materials and pipes were consumed by the machines.

### Key Features for the Software:

1. **Inventory Tracking & Updates**:
   - Real-time tracking of raw materials, pipe lengths, and cut pieces.
   - Automatic update of inventory when raw materials are used, and pipes are processed by both machines.

2. **Parameter Management for the Tube Machine**:
   - Interface to input and edit pipe parameters like OD, thickness, and material grade.
   - Store and display parameters for each batch of pipes created.

3. **Pipe Tracking**:
   - Unique identifiers for each pipe or batch.
   - Track when and where each pipe is used (in laser machine or elsewhere).
   - Track the pipe dimensions, grade, and status (full-length or cut).

4. **Laser Machine Tracking**:
   - After pipes are processed by the laser machine, log the cut lengths and update the inventory accordingly.
   - Ensure that the material’s original grade and dimensions are preserved during the cutting process.

5. **Reporting & Analytics**:
   - Generate reports on material usage, production status, and inventory levels.
   - Provide alerts or notifications when material stock is low or needs reordering.

### Data Model:

Here’s a simplified version of what your database schema could look like:

#### 1. **RawMaterials Table**:
   - `MaterialID` (Primary Key)
   - `MaterialGrade`
   - `QuantityAvailable`

#### 2. **Pipe Table**:
   - `PipeID` (Primary Key)
   - `OD`
   - `Thickness`
   - `Grade`
   - `Length`
   - `MaterialID` (Foreign Key to RawMaterials)
   - `Status` (Full-Length, Cut, In-Progress, etc.)
   - `CreatedDate`

#### 3. **LaserMachineProcessing Table**:
   - `LaserID` (Primary Key)
   - `PipeID` (Foreign Key to Pipe)
   - `CutLength`
   - `NumberOfPieces`
   - `ProcessedDate`

#### 4. **Inventory Table**:
   - `InventoryID` (Primary Key)
   - `MaterialID` (Foreign Key to RawMaterials)
   - `PipeID` (Foreign Key to Pipe)
   - `Quantity`
   - `Type` (Raw, Full-Length, Cut)
   - `Status` (Available, Used, In-Process)

### Example Workflow:

- **Raw Materials Arrive**: You input the material grade and quantity into the system. The `RawMaterials` table is updated.
  
- **Pipe Production**: The tube machine takes raw material and produces a pipe with a specific OD, thickness, and grade. You log this pipe into the `Pipe` table and update inventory.
  
- **Laser Machine Processing**: A full-length pipe is fed into the laser machine. After cutting, you record the new pieces and their dimensions into the `LaserMachineProcessing` table and update the inventory accordingly.

### Technology Stack Suggestions:
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django), Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, etc.
- **Frontend**: React.js, Angular, or Vue.js for an interactive interface.
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for relational data management.
- **Inventory Management Framework**: You could build custom business logic or integrate with a framework like Odoo or ERPNext if you're looking for out-of-the-box solutions.

You're welcome! Let's walk through the example in detail with real-time steps, keeping your inventory and machine setup in mind.

### Case Details:
- **Raw Material Grade**: 401
- **Pipe Parameters**:
  1. **20 Pipes**: OD 10mm, Thickness 5mm
  2. **30 Pipes**: OD 5mm, Thickness 5mm
- **Machine 1**: Tube Machine (producing full-length pipes)
- **Machine 2**: Laser Machine (cutting pipes into smaller lengths)

### Scenario Overview:
1. **Step 1**: **Raw Material Handling**  
   The raw material (Grade 401) is used to create the pipes. Let's assume the available stock of Grade 401 raw material is sufficient for both pipe batches.

2. **Step 2**: **Tube Machine Production**
   - You first produce **20 pipes** with the following parameters: **OD 10mm**, **Thickness 5mm**.
   - Then, you produce **30 pipes** with the same grade but different parameters: **OD 5mm**, **Thickness 5mm**.

3. **Step 3**: **Pipe Inventory**
   The pipes are created and entered into your inventory system.

4. **Step 4**: **Laser Machine Processing**
   You then send some of these pipes to the **Laser Machine** to cut them into smaller lengths. For simplicity, let's assume the following:
   - From the **20 pipes** (OD 10mm), you send **10 pipes** to the laser machine.
   - From the **30 pipes** (OD 5mm), you send **15 pipes** to the laser machine.

After the laser machine processes them, they are converted into smaller pieces, and you need to track the cut lengths and update the inventory accordingly.

---

### Real-Time Example:

#### Step 1: **Raw Material Input**
- Assume **Grade 401** raw material is available. Initially, you have an inventory record like this:

| **MaterialID** | **MaterialGrade** | **QuantityAvailable** |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 1              | 401               | 1000 kg               |

You have 1000 kg of **Grade 401** material available.

#### Step 2: **Tube Machine Production**

##### 2.1 Pipe 1: **20 Pipes (OD 10mm, Thickness 5mm)**
- The tube machine takes 100 kg of **Grade 401** raw material (let’s assume it uses 5 kg per pipe).
- 20 pipes are created, each with **OD 10mm** and **Thickness 5mm**.
- Your system records these 20 pipes in the inventory:

| **PipeID** | **OD (mm)** | **Thickness (mm)** | **Grade** | **Length (m)** | **Status**     | **CreatedDate** |
|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1          | 10          | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length    | 2024-12-01      |
| 2          | 10          | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length    | 2024-12-01      |
| ...        | ...         | ...                | ...       | ...            | ...            | ...             |
| 20         | 10          | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length    | 2024-12-01      |

- After production, the **Pipe Inventory** has 20 full-length pipes with **OD 10mm** and **Thickness 5mm**.

##### 2.2 Pipe 2: **30 Pipes (OD 5mm, Thickness 5mm)**
- The tube machine uses another 150 kg of **Grade 401** raw material (5 kg per pipe).
- 30 pipes are created with **OD 5mm** and **Thickness 5mm**.
- Your system records these 30 pipes in the inventory:

| **PipeID** | **OD (mm)** | **Thickness (mm)** | **Grade** | **Length (m)** | **Status**     | **CreatedDate** |
|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 21         | 5           | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length    | 2024-12-01      |
| 22         | 5           | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length    | 2024-12-01      |
| ...        | ...         | ...                | ...       | ...            | ...            | ...             |
| 50         | 5           | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length    | 2024-12-01      |

- After this, you now have **50 full-length pipes** in your inventory: 20 pipes with **OD 10mm** and 30 pipes with **OD 5mm**.

#### Step 3: **Laser Machine Processing**

Now, let’s process some of the pipes in the laser machine. Let’s assume:

- **10 pipes** (OD 10mm, Thickness 5mm) are sent to the laser machine.
- **15 pipes** (OD 5mm, Thickness 5mm) are also sent to the laser machine.

#### Step 4: **Cutting Process and Inventory Update**

Let’s assume the laser machine cuts each pipe into **2 smaller pieces** (this is an arbitrary assumption, you can adjust this based on real cutting data).

##### 4.1 Cutting Process for 10 Pipes (OD 10mm)
- For each of the **10 pipes** (OD 10mm), the laser machine cuts them into **2 pieces**. This means you will have **20 smaller pieces**.
- The inventory of the **laser machine** processing would look like this:

| **LaserID** | **PipeID** | **CutLength (m)** | **NumberOfPieces** | **ProcessedDate** |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 1           | 1          | 3                 | 2                  | 2024-12-01        |
| 2           | 2          | 3                 | 2                  | 2024-12-01        |
| ...         | ...        | ...               | ...                | ...               |
| 10          | 10         | 3                 | 2                  | 2024-12-01        |

So, now you have **20 smaller pieces** from the 10 full-length pipes.

##### 4.2 Cutting Process for 15 Pipes (OD 5mm)
- For each of the **15 pipes** (OD 5mm), the laser machine also cuts them into **2 pieces**. This gives you **30 smaller pieces**.
- The inventory of the **laser machine** processing would look like this:

| **LaserID** | **PipeID** | **CutLength (m)** | **NumberOfPieces** | **ProcessedDate** |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 11          | 21         | 3                 | 2                  | 2024-12-01        |
| 12          | 22         | 3                 | 2                  | 2024-12-01        |
| ...         | ...        | ...               | ...                | ...               |
| 25          | 35         | 3                 | 2                  | 2024-12-01        |

So, now you have **30 smaller pieces** from the 15 full-length pipes.

#### Step 5: **Updated Inventory After Laser Processing**

After processing, your **inventory** would look like this:

##### Full-Length Pipe Inventory (Remaining):
| **PipeID** | **OD (mm)** | **Thickness (mm)** | **Grade** | **Length (m)** | **Status**   | **CreatedDate** |
|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 11         | 10          | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length  | 2024-12-01      |
| 12         | 10          | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length  | 2024-12-01      |
| ...        | ...         | ...                | ...       | ...            | ...          | ...             |
| 50         | 5           | 5                  | 401       | 6              | Full-Length  | 2024-12-01      |

- After laser cutting, the **remaining full-length pipes** will be reduced to **remaining pipes** that are not yet sent to the laser machine.

##### Cut Pipe Inventory (New Entries):
| **CutPipeID** | **OD (mm)** | **Thickness (mm)** | **CutLength (m)** | **PiecesCreated** | **ProcessedDate** |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1             | 10          | 5                  | 3                 | 2                 | 2024-12-01        |
| 2             | 10          | 5                  | 3                 | 2                 | 2024-12-01        |
| ...           | ...         | ...                | ...               | ...               | ...               |
| 20            | 5           | 5                  | 3                 | 2

Great, glad the example helped! Now, let’s break down how you can implement this using the tables and the corresponding SQL queries. I'll explain which table gets used in each part of the process and what SQL queries are fired based on the steps.

We'll go step-by-step and use the `Inventory`, `RawMaterials`, `Pipe`, and `LaserMachineProcessing` tables from our earlier example.

### 1. **Raw Material Input and Tracking**
When you receive raw materials, you'll update the **RawMaterials** table. If the raw material grade (e.g., Grade 401) is not yet in the system, it gets added. If it's already there, the quantity gets updated.

#### SQL Query for Raw Material Input:
To insert raw material when it's first received:

```sql
-- Add new raw material entry
INSERT INTO RawMaterials (MaterialGrade, QuantityAvailable)
VALUES ('401', 1000); -- 1000 kg of Grade 401
```

To update the quantity if the material already exists in the system:

```sql
-- Update existing raw material quantity
UPDATE RawMaterials
SET QuantityAvailable = QuantityAvailable + 1000
WHERE MaterialGrade = '401';
```

### 2. **Pipe Creation (Using Tube Machine)**

When you create pipes from raw material, you will:
1. Subtract the raw material quantity based on the number of pipes being produced.
2. Create records in the **Pipe** table for the full-length pipes.

#### Example: Creating 20 pipes with OD 10mm, Thickness 5mm, and Grade 401

For each pipe, let’s assume it uses 5kg of raw material, so for 20 pipes, you’ll need **100kg** of Grade 401 raw material.

#### Step 2.1: **Update Raw Materials (Subtract the Used Quantity)**

```sql
-- Decrease raw material quantity by 100 kg (for 20 pipes of 5kg each)
UPDATE RawMaterials
SET QuantityAvailable = QuantityAvailable - 100
WHERE MaterialGrade = '401';
```

#### Step 2.2: **Insert Pipes into the Pipe Table**

Now, for each pipe produced, you insert it into the **Pipe** table.

```sql
-- Insert 20 full-length pipes (OD 10mm, Thickness 5mm, Grade 401)
INSERT INTO Pipe (OD, Thickness, Grade, Length, Status, CreatedDate)
VALUES 
  (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE),
  (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE),
  -- Repeat for all 20 pipes
  (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE);
```

The above query would create 20 pipes with **OD 10mm** and **Thickness 5mm**, and it sets the `Status` to "Full-Length".

### 3. **Laser Machine Processing**

When you send pipes to the laser machine, you will:
1. Update the **Pipe** table to reflect that those pipes have been processed (changing the status to something like "Processed" or "Cut").
2. Insert records into the **LaserMachineProcessing** table to track the cutting process (e.g., the number of pieces and their new lengths).

#### Example: Sending 10 pipes with OD 10mm to the laser machine (cutting them into 2 pieces each)

##### Step 3.1: **Update the Pipe Table (Mark as Processed)**

You can update the status of the pipes that were sent to the laser machine:

```sql
-- Update the status of the first 10 pipes to "Processed"
UPDATE Pipe
SET Status = 'Processed'
WHERE PipeID BETWEEN 1 AND 10;  -- Assuming the first 10 pipes have PipeID from 1 to 10
```

##### Step 3.2: **Insert Laser Machine Processing Records**

Now, create records in the **LaserMachineProcessing** table, reflecting the cuts made on each pipe.

```sql
-- Insert cutting details for the first 10 pipes (OD 10mm, 2 pieces per pipe)
INSERT INTO LaserMachineProcessing (PipeID, CutLength, NumberOfPieces, ProcessedDate)
VALUES 
  (1, 3, 2, CURRENT_DATE),  -- Pipe 1 cut into 2 pieces of 3 meters each
  (2, 3, 2, CURRENT_DATE),
  -- Repeat for the remaining 9 pipes
  (10, 3, 2, CURRENT_DATE);
```

This query records that each of the 10 pipes was cut into **2 smaller pieces**, each of **3 meters** long. The `ProcessedDate` is set to the current date.

### 4. **Inventory Table Management**

The **Inventory** table tracks the stock of raw materials, full-length pipes, and cut pieces. It acts as a consolidated view of your stock.

Each time a new pipe or material is created, you'll update the **Inventory** table to reflect changes in stock.

#### Example: Updating the Inventory Table After Pipe Creation

After creating 20 full-length pipes, you need to add those to the **Inventory** table. Since these are full-length pipes, you would set the `Type` to `Full-Length`.

```sql
-- Insert the newly created pipes into the inventory
INSERT INTO Inventory (MaterialID, PipeID, Quantity, Type, Status)
VALUES 
  (1, 1, 1, 'Full-Length', 'Available'), -- 1 full-length pipe with ID 1
  (1, 2, 1, 'Full-Length', 'Available'),
  -- Repeat for all 20 pipes
  (1, 20, 1, 'Full-Length', 'Available');
```

#### Example: Updating the Inventory After Laser Processing

When pipes are cut into smaller pieces, you'll update the **Inventory** table to reflect the newly created pieces. Here, the `Type` will be `Cut`, and you will track the number of pieces.

```sql
-- Add the smaller cut pieces to the inventory after laser cutting
INSERT INTO Inventory (MaterialID, PipeID, Quantity, Type, Status)
VALUES 
  (1, 1, 2, 'Cut', 'Available'), -- 2 cut pieces from Pipe 1
  (1, 2, 2, 'Cut', 'Available'),
  -- Repeat for the remaining pipes
  (1, 10, 2, 'Cut', 'Available');
```

This will create **2 pieces** for each of the **10 pipes** processed by the laser machine.

### 5. **Final Inventory View**

After all the above operations, your **Inventory** table would look something like this:

| **InventoryID** | **MaterialID** | **PipeID** | **Quantity** | **Type**      | **Status**  |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1               | 1              | 1          | 1            | Full-Length   | Available   |
| 2               | 1              | 2          | 1            | Full-Length   | Available   |
| ...             | ...            | ...        | ...          | ...           | ...         |
| 20              | 1              | 20         | 1            | Full-Length   | Available   |
| 21              | 1              | 1          | 2            | Cut           | Available   |
| 22              | 1              | 2          | 2            | Cut           | Available   |
| ...             | ...            | ...        | ...          | ...           | ...         |
| 50              | 1              | 10         | 2            | Cut           | Available   |

This view gives you an overall picture of your inventory, including:
- **Full-Length Pipes**: 20 pipes in total.
- **Cut Pipes**: 50 smaller pieces from the laser machine.

### Recap of the Flow:

1. **Raw Material Input**:
   - Update **RawMaterials** (add or update).
2. **Pipe Creation**:
   - Update **RawMaterials** (subtract the raw material).
   - Insert records into the **Pipe** table (full-length pipes).
   - Update **Inventory** for full-length pipes.
3. **Laser Machine Processing**:
   - Update **Pipe** table to mark pipes as processed.
   - Insert records into **LaserMachineProcessing** (details of cutting).
   - Update **Inventory** for the new cut pieces.

This entire flow allows you to manage your inventory and track the transformation of raw materials into pipes and cut pieces, while ensuring your system remains up-to-date with real-time data.

You’re absolutely right! Directly updating values in the database can lead to problems if the query is executed multiple times by mistake (e.g., due to a re-submission, a system failure, or a user error). This is a critical issue in any system where multiple transactions or operations could be repeated unintentionally.

To handle such issues safely, **transaction management** and **idempotency** are essential principles. Here’s how you can approach this:

### 1. **Use Transactions**
Transactions allow you to group multiple SQL queries into a single unit of work. If something goes wrong (e.g., a query fails), the entire transaction can be rolled back to ensure that no changes are made to the database. This ensures that your data remains consistent.

### 2. **Idempotent Operations**
Idempotency ensures that repeated requests or operations don’t have any additional effect after the first successful execution. If a user submits the same request twice, it won’t have unintended consequences, such as deducting inventory twice or creating duplicate records.

### 3. **Checks for Repeated Requests**
Before making changes (like updating inventory or creating new records), you can add checks to prevent the same request from being processed multiple times.

Let’s discuss how to apply these techniques.

---

### **1. Use Transactions to Prevent Partial Updates**
A **transaction** will ensure that all database updates (such as adjusting raw material quantities, inserting new pipes, etc.) happen together. If any query fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

For example, in **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**, you can use the following pattern:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct raw material from the inventory (e.g., 100kg used)
UPDATE RawMaterials
SET QuantityAvailable = QuantityAvailable - 100
WHERE MaterialGrade = '401';

-- Insert 20 pipes into the Pipe table
INSERT INTO Pipe (OD, Thickness, Grade, Length, Status, CreatedDate)
VALUES 
  (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE),
  (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE),
  -- Repeat for all 20 pipes
  (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE);

-- Update the inventory table (for full-length pipes)
INSERT INTO Inventory (MaterialID, PipeID, Quantity, Type, Status)
VALUES 
  (1, 1, 1, 'Full-Length', 'Available'),
  (1, 2, 1, 'Full-Length', 'Available'),
  -- Repeat for all 20 pipes
  (1, 20, 1, 'Full-Length', 'Available');

-- If everything is fine, commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

If any part of the transaction fails, you can **ROLLBACK** the transaction to undo all changes:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

This ensures that partial updates do not leave your system in an inconsistent state.

### **2. Implement Idempotency (Prevent Duplicate Updates)**

You can avoid running the same query multiple times by using **idempotent keys** or **unique transaction identifiers**.

#### Example: Using an **idempotent request ID** or **transaction ID**

Let’s say the user submits a request to create pipes. You can generate a unique request ID (e.g., a UUID) when the request is first received. Then, you can use this ID to check whether the same request has been processed before, avoiding duplicates.

#### Approach 1: **Transaction ID in the Request**

1. **Generate a unique transaction ID** on the client-side (e.g., a UUID or hash of the request data).
2. **Store the transaction ID** along with the request details in a separate table (e.g., `TransactionLog`).
3. Before executing any updates (like creating pipes or deducting inventory), you check if that transaction ID already exists in the `TransactionLog`. If it does, skip the operation.

##### **Example: Transaction Log Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE TransactionLog (
  TransactionID VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique ID for each request
  Status VARCHAR(50),                      -- Status of the transaction (e.g., 'Processed', 'Pending')
  CreatedDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

##### **SQL Flow for Idempotency**

1. **Check if the transaction has already been processed**:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT Status
   FROM TransactionLog
   WHERE TransactionID = 'some-unique-id';
   ```

   If the `Status` is `'Processed'`, you don’t need to execute the same query again. If not, you proceed.

2. **If the transaction hasn't been processed**, insert it into the `TransactionLog` and proceed with the actual database updates:

   ```sql
   -- Insert a new transaction record with status 'Pending'
   INSERT INTO TransactionLog (TransactionID, Status)
   VALUES ('some-unique-id', 'Pending');

   -- Now proceed with the regular operations (e.g., updating RawMaterials, inserting Pipes, etc.)
   -- Start Transaction
   START TRANSACTION;

   -- Deduct raw material
   UPDATE RawMaterials
   SET QuantityAvailable = QuantityAvailable - 100
   WHERE MaterialGrade = '401';

   -- Insert pipes into the Pipe table
   INSERT INTO Pipe (OD, Thickness, Grade, Length, Status, CreatedDate)
   VALUES 
     (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE),
     (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE);

   -- Insert into Inventory table
   INSERT INTO Inventory (MaterialID, PipeID, Quantity, Type, Status)
   VALUES 
     (1, 1, 1, 'Full-Length', 'Available'),
     (1, 2, 1, 'Full-Length', 'Available');

   -- If everything is fine, update the transaction status to 'Processed' and commit
   COMMIT;

   -- Update the TransactionLog with 'Processed' status
   UPDATE TransactionLog
   SET Status = 'Processed'
   WHERE TransactionID = 'some-unique-id';
   ```

By using this method, if the same request is submitted again with the same transaction ID, it will be ignored because the status of the transaction will already be `Processed`.

#### Approach 2: **Check for Existing Records Before Insertion**
Alternatively, you can check if the record already exists in the **Pipe** or **Inventory** tables before inserting.

```sql
-- Check if the pipe with the same parameters already exists in the Pipe table
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Pipe
WHERE OD = 10 AND Thickness = 5 AND Grade = '401' AND Length = 6;

-- If the count is 0, then insert
IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Pipe WHERE OD = 10 AND Thickness = 5 AND Grade = '401' AND Length = 6) = 0
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Pipe (OD, Thickness, Grade, Length, Status, CreatedDate)
    VALUES (10, 5, '401', 6, 'Full-Length', CURRENT_DATE);
END
```

This check ensures that you won’t insert duplicate pipes, preventing the same pipe from being counted or inserted multiple times.

### 3. **Handling Duplicate Submissions in the Web Application (Client Side)**

In addition to server-side measures, you should also handle duplicate submissions at the client-side by:

- **Disabling the submit button** after the first submission to prevent users from clicking multiple times.
- **Timeout or delay**: If you expect a delay in processing (e.g., a transaction takes time), you can show a loading spinner and disable any further action until the operation completes.
  
### 4. **Using Unique Identifiers (UUID) for Pipes and Transactions**

To further ensure consistency, you can use **UUIDs** for pipes, transaction IDs, and laser cutting events. This guarantees that each record has a unique identifier, making it easier to prevent conflicts or duplication in case of re-submission.

#### Example for Pipe UUID:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Pipe (
  PipeID UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),  -- UUID automatically generated
  OD INT,
  Thickness INT,
  Grade VARCHAR(50),
  Length INT,
  Status VARCHAR(50),
  CreatedDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Summary of Key Strategies:
1. **Use Transactions**: Wrap your updates in a transaction to ensure atomicity (all-or-nothing).
2. **Idempotency**: Use a unique transaction ID or request ID to ensure repeated submissions don't result in duplicate records.
3. **Check for Existing Data**: Before inserting records, check if they already exist.
4. **Client-Side Measures**: Prevent double submission by disabling the submit button or showing loading states.

By following these strategies, you can significantly reduce the risk of errors caused by accidental re-submissions or duplicate queries.

Ah, I see your concern now! You want to ensure that, in case of mistakes (e.g., wrong entries, incorrect stock updates, or any other data errors), you can easily edit or correct them. Additionally, you need a way to track all changes (especially today's entries) and be able to undo or modify them when needed.

Here’s how you can handle this situation:

### 1. **Tracking Changes and Error Corrections:**
To handle wrong entries or corrections, you can implement a combination of the following approaches:

- **Audit Logs**: Keep a log of every operation (insert, update, delete) performed on the database. This will allow you to trace and undo any operations if a mistake is made.
- **Soft Deletes and Status Tracking**: Rather than directly updating stock quantities or deleting records, consider using "soft deletes" and status tracking. This way, you don’t lose any data but mark entries as “invalid” or “canceled” if a mistake occurs.
- **Editable Entries**: For data that needs to be corrected, allow for modifications with proper validation and logging.

### 2. **Audit Log Table:**

You can create an **Audit Log** table to keep track of changes. Every time a transaction is performed (like updating stock or creating a new pipe), you insert a log entry into this table. This helps you to track what happened, who did it, and when it occurred.

#### Example: Audit Log Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE AuditLog (
  AuditID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,          -- Auto-incremented ID
  TableName VARCHAR(255),              -- Table being modified (e.g., 'Inventory', 'Pipe', etc.)
  OperationType VARCHAR(50),           -- Operation type: 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
  RecordID INT,                        -- ID of the record being modified
  OldValue TEXT,                       -- Old value (before update)
  NewValue TEXT,                       -- New value (after update)
  UserID INT,                          -- ID of the user making the change
  OperationDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,  -- Date of operation
  Remarks TEXT                         -- Optional remarks (e.g., reason for correction)
);
```

#### Example Query to Log an Operation

Let’s say you update the raw material quantity, and you want to log that update in the `AuditLog` table.

```sql
-- Start by recording the old value
SELECT QuantityAvailable 
FROM RawMaterials
WHERE MaterialGrade = '401';

-- Then, perform the update (deducting 100kg of raw material)
UPDATE RawMaterials
SET QuantityAvailable = QuantityAvailable - 100
WHERE MaterialGrade = '401';

-- Log this operation in the AuditLog table
INSERT INTO AuditLog (TableName, OperationType, RecordID, OldValue, NewValue, UserID, Remarks)
VALUES ('RawMaterials', 'UPDATE', 1, '1000', '900', 123, 'Deducted 100kg for pipe creation');
```

Now, if there’s an issue, you can trace exactly what was changed, who made the change, and when it happened.

### 3. **Soft Deletes and Status Tracking**

Instead of immediately modifying or deleting records when there’s a mistake, you can use **status flags** or **soft deletes**. 

#### Example 1: **Soft Deletes in Inventory Table**

Instead of deleting a pipe from the inventory table when a mistake is made, mark it as "invalid" or "canceled."

```sql
-- Mark a pipe as canceled instead of deleting it
UPDATE Inventory
SET Status = 'Canceled'
WHERE PipeID = 123;  -- Example pipe ID
```

You can later review the canceled items and decide whether to delete them permanently or correct them.

#### Example 2: **Status Flag for Corrected Records**

If you’ve made an error when updating stock, you can mark that record as “incorrect” and create a new record with the corrected data.

```sql
-- Mark an incorrect entry (e.g., wrong amount of stock added)
UPDATE Inventory
SET Status = 'Incorrect'
WHERE InventoryID = 10;

-- Insert a new corrected entry
INSERT INTO Inventory (MaterialID, PipeID, Quantity, Type, Status)
VALUES (1, 1, 10, 'Full-Length', 'Available');
```

### 4. **Displaying Today's Entries or Recent Modifications**

To see all entries that were made today (whether they’re updates, insertions, or corrections), you can query the **AuditLog** or the relevant tables and filter by the current date.

#### Example: Query to Get Today's Entries from AuditLog

```sql
-- Get today's entries from the AuditLog
SELECT * 
FROM AuditLog
WHERE DATE(OperationDate) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

This will give you a list of all operations performed today, including updates, inserts, and deletes. You can filter the `TableName` or `OperationType` to get more specific results.

#### Example: Query to Get Today's Entries from Inventory Table

If you want to check today’s stock changes in the **Inventory** table (e.g., pipes created or updated today):

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Inventory
WHERE DATE(CreatedDate) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

This will give you all the entries created today. If you’re tracking **status** changes (e.g., marking items as invalid), you can extend this query to check for status updates:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Inventory
WHERE DATE(StatusUpdateDate) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### 5. **Correcting Mistakes in the Inventory**

If a wrong entry was made and you want to fix it:

- **Undo the Mistake**: If the mistake is simple (e.g., you added too many pipes), you can **revert** the operation by reversing it (e.g., adding back the excess stock or removing the extra pipes).

- **Manual Correction**: In cases where a more complex mistake was made, like wrong values entered, you can correct them by updating the affected records:

#### Example: Reverting or Correcting an Entry in Inventory

Let’s say 10 pipes were accidentally added instead of 5:

1. **Undo the original (incorrect) entry**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE Inventory
   SET Quantity = Quantity - 10
   WHERE PipeID = 123;
   ```

2. **Insert the correct number of pipes**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE Inventory
   SET Quantity = Quantity + 5
   WHERE PipeID = 123;
   ```

### 6. **Tracking Changes in a User-Friendly Way**

In your software interface, you can:

1. **Allow Users to View Logs**: Provide an option to view logs or audit trails, showing who changed what and when. This can be useful for administrators or managers who need to verify or audit transactions.
   
2. **Allow Easy Undo Operations**: In the case of user errors, you can add a simple “undo” functionality based on the **AuditLog**. For example, if an incorrect update was made, you can retrieve the previous value from the log and reverse the change.

### Example Undo Functionality:
In your application, you could allow the admin to see logs and then undo an operation:

1. Show the list of logs for the user.
2. Select an operation to undo (based on the `AuditLog`).
3. Reverse the changes (either by redoing the operation or inserting an opposite change).

### Example Query for Reverting an Operation Based on Audit Log

```sql
-- Get the last update on a pipe
SELECT * 
FROM AuditLog
WHERE TableName = 'Inventory' AND RecordID = 123
ORDER BY OperationDate DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Revert the operation if necessary (based on audit log data)
-- For example, if the last operation was a stock addition, you can subtract the same amount
UPDATE Inventory
SET Quantity = Quantity - 10
WHERE PipeID = 123;
```

### Summary of Key Concepts:

1. **Audit Logs**: Keep track of every change to the database (insert, update, delete). This helps you track who made what change and when.
2. **Soft Deletes**: Mark records as "invalid" or "canceled" rather than deleting them outright. This allows for recovery if needed.
3. **Status Tracking**: Use status flags to indicate if an entry is "correct," "incorrect," or "canceled."
4. **Today’s Entries**: Use queries to filter changes made today from the `AuditLog` or your main tables.
5. **Error Correction**: To fix mistakes, either undo the previous operation by reversing it or correct the value by updating it manually.

By incorporating these methods, you can manage changes more safely, track mistakes, and correct them when necessary, all while keeping your data consistent and easily auditable.
